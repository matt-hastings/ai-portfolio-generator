1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
oh it worked anthropic just launched a

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,519
model with a 100 000 total context

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,099
window this is a 10x Improvement and

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,199
context window size and enables us to

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,300
now feed entire books or any long

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,580
document directly into the model and

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,618
then ask complex questions about the

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:18,839
input text most other language models at

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,820
the moment can handle only between two

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,278
to eight K tokens with a few exceptions

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,820
but 100K is unseen to the state so this

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,980
is an incredible step forward so let me

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,420
explain what this means and then I'll

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,279
show you a cool demo the context window

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,859
refers to the total number of tokens an

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,679
llm can take in at inference time a

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,079
helpful rule of thumb is that 100 tokens

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,200
correspond to around 75 words so for

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,200
example if a model can handle 4096

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
tokens you can feed around 3 000 words

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,659
into it with anthropic's new Cloud Model

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,238
you can now feed around 75 000 words

23
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,759
into it let's put this in context Mary

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,920
Shelley's Frankenstein contains around

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,738
75 000 Earth so the whole book fits into

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,840
the model this five hour long podcast

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
contains 58 000 words and about 65 000

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,780
words are spoken in eight Star Wars

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,000
episodes to consume and digest this

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,219
content it takes us humans many many

31
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,040
hours Claude can do all of this in less

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,900
than one minute here are some possible

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,938
things you can do with it for example

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,579
Claude can digest summarize and explain

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,560
technical documents like financial

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,900
statements legal contracts or research

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,060
papers you can also use it to ask

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,099
questions and find answers in Long

39
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,799
documents without having to search just

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,140
drop your documents into the context and

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,879
ask what you're looking for but it can

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,618
do much more than summarization or

43
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,540
simple Q and A because the whole

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,759
document is in the context Claude can

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,280
respond with analysis or perform complex

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,500
tasks that require synthesizing

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,959
information across the entirety of your

48
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,180
document in my opinion this is awesome

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,099
but I think instead of just talking

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,379
about it let's look at it in action so

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,719
let's look at a demo and I want to try

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,239
this out with a podcast episode from The

53
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,700
Lex Friedman podcast and this is the

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,978
episode with John Carmack one of the

55
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:10,500
founders of Doom and Quake this is a

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,300
pretty cool episode which I highly

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,180
recommend watching but it is five hours

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,699
long so now I want to analyze this much

59
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,580
quicker and the first step is to get the

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,560
transcript so we get the text that we

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,719
can then feed into the model for this we

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,719
can use our assembly AI API and I

63
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,580
already created a lot of tutorials here

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,560
on this channel how to do this so I

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,780
won't go into detail now but basically

66
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,120
here I have a helper function that sends

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,060
two API requests one to start the

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,919
transcript and then want to get the

69
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,199
transcript when it's completed and then

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,019
I will save this to a Json file and you

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,598
could either upload a local file or if

72
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,340
the file is already hosted somewhere

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
then you can use the URL directly which

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,419
is the case here so you can get this

75
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,400
from various places here I'm using

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,459
listen notes so now let's run the code

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,860
and get our transcript and it worked and

78
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,080
saved the file so let's take a quick

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,539
look here we get the text the following

80
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,180
is a conversation with John CarMax so it

81
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,419
worked and as you can see this is a very

82
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,419
long file here so it would take us a lot

83
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,239
of time to consume this content so the

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,979
first thing I want to do is to tell

85
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,680
Claude to give us a summary of this so

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,139
let's load our text again and then first

87
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,598
let's get a rough estimation of how many

88
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,120
words are in it by calling the dot split

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,459
method and then also by applying our

90
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,639
rule of thumb to get the tokens so as

91
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,759
you can see we have almost 58 000 words

92
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,120
in it and 77 000 tokens so this should

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,919
fit into the model and how to use

94
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,719
anthropics Claude we can use their

95
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,060
python SDK that we can install and then

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,979
import and then of course we also need

97
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,439
an API token and then we can set up a

98
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,598
client and then we call client

99
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,180
completion and give it a prompt and also

100
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,219
select a model as you can see here we

101
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,280
use claw version 1.3 and then the new

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,519
one with the 100K context window then we

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,860
also set the max tokens to sample and

104
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,620
then we print response.completion and

105
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,378
now we need to specify our prompt so let

106
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,139
me copy and paste this here so first we

107
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,540
give a little bit of context we say here

108
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,699
is the transcript of a Lex Friedman

109
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,639
podcast and then we dump the whole

110
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,339
transcript in here and then we say

111
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,560
you're an expert at writing factual

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
summaries write a summary of the

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,060
transcript in about 10 sentences and

114
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,220
then the assistant replies with I would

115
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,500
be happy to help here's the summary so

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,660
let's run this and see what we get and

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,759
here we get our summary so let's read it

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,639
very quickly John Carmack is a legendary

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,620
programmer and game developer who

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
co-founded ID software he is known for

121
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,439
groundbreaking games like Wolfenstein 3D

122
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,439
doom and Quake which is correct then he

123
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,600
started programming as a kit and quickly

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,540
developed a passion for it then also he

125
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,939
left softest and started ID software

126
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,279
then they're talking about 3D graphics

127
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,000
and this time at Oculus then also about

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,100
AGI so yeah all of this is correct so

129
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,139
now that we know what the podcast is

130
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,600
about let's ask some specific questions

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,360
about a few topics so first let me copy

132
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,579
and paste the same code in here and now

133
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,199
since I know that they are talking about

134
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,839
programming let's ask a question about

135
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,779
this section so let me ask based on the

136
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,819
transcript what are some of karmic's

137
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,399
views on C plus select one or two

138
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,199
relevant quotations about C plus plus

139
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,699
from the transcript and then explain

140
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,279
karmic's opinion and by the way we can

141
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,439
also get rid of this this is just to set

142
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,199
the tone a little bit so let's try this

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,139
prompt and here we get our response so

144
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,120
here are two relevant quotations from

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,639
karmic about C plus plus when I'm

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,680
sitting down to do what I consider kind

147
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,899
of serious programming it's still in C

148
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,300
plus plus and it's really kind of a c

149
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,639
flavored C plus plus at that where I'm

150
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,100
not big into the modern template meta

151
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,620
programming sort of things and also he

152
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,418
says that he spent a few years working

153
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:08,879
with lisp and Haskell and then later

154
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,160
here he says and that changed a lot of

155
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,680
the way I write my C plus code based on

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,660
what I learned and then the model

157
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,600
concludes based on these quotes it seems

158
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,759
karmic value C plus plus for serious

159
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,339
programming work but prefers a simpler C

160
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,379
flavored style without heavy use of

161
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,839
templates or object orientation so I

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,699
think this is really impressive it

163
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,100
answered a specific question about one

164
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,379
of the topics in this long podcast now

165
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,819
let's ask for something where the model

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,918
has to look in different places of the

167
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,560
podcast so let me again copy and paste

168
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,699
this and now let's ask here do they talk

169
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,660
about what video games Carmack

170
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,959
developed and then let's say if so

171
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,918
please list them here so let's run this

172
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,319
cell and I made a small typo but it

173
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,879
didn't matter so here we got our

174
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,279
response yes Sean karmic discusses

175
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,079
several video games that he developed in

176
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,418
the conversation and then it lists it as

177
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,139
requested wolvenstein 3D Doom quake and

178
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,660
Commander Keane he also mentions other

179
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,939
games that he was inspired by like Super

180
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,459
Mario Bros Battlezone or Star Wars the

181
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,680
our card game and finally he discusses

182
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,720
some of the tools and Technologies used

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,879
to develop these games so yeah I think

184
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,220
this is super helpful so it even found

185
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,620
some more information so to me this is

186
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,538
very impressive and I also have to give

187
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,759
a shout out to our assembly AI API

188
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,860
because the transcript was very accurate

189
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,598
and worked perfectly together with

190
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,879
Claude so here are just two more cool

191
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,098
ideas you can try out with it for

192
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,959
example you could throw in entire

193
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,839
documentation pages and then ask please

194
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,819
review these documents carefully and

195
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,860
then provide a summary of a specific

196
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,918
section in this case or you can throw in

197
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,199
entire long papers for example from

198
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,899
archive and then then ask can you

199
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:03,660
explain the section on XXX to me please

200
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,579
briefly explain the background ideas and

201
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,379
then explain the new contributions of

202
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,538
this paper so yeah try this out on your

203
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:10,740
own and let me know what you think

204
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,598
alright hopefully this demo could give

205
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,699
you an idea of what's possible with this

206
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,459
100K context window model now if you've

207
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,439
watched our last video about Vector

208
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,660
databases I will drop this here you

209
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,459
might be wondering if this makes them

210
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,038
unnecessary well this large context

211
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,899
window doesn't completely solve the

212
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,478
problem for a longer context or if you

213
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,639
need to query over a collection of books

214
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,799
or transcripts for example you'd still

215
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,839
need additional workarounds to store the

216
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,479
data but if your data fits into the

217
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,639
context window this new model indeed

218
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,740
helps to avoid spinning up custom Vector

219
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,019
databases to me this is an incredible

220
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,059
step forward and I think you just gotta

221
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,799
try it yourself and play around with the

222
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,600
model to get a feeling for what this

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,879
enables so let me know in the comments

224
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,500
what you think about it so if you want

225
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,299
to try it out and learn more then check

226
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,519
out anthropics blog post about it all

227
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,679
also if you want to easily combine this

228
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,720
with audio or video data then check out

229
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,539
our assembly AI API both links will be

230
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,458
in the description below and I hope you

231
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,899
enjoyed this video and then I hope to

232
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,040
see you next time bye
